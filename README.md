# Lab | Advanced Tableau Visualization

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create a Choropleth map to analyze geographical data.
- Construct and interpret a regression plot to understand the relationship between two quantitative variables.
- Utilize boxplots to compare distributions and identify outliers in the context of vehicle size categories.
- Assemble a comprehensive dashboard that incorporates a variety of chart types.
- Craft a story in Tableau that summarizes your analytical findings.

### Instructions

Continue your exploration of Tableau's advanced visualization capabilities using the `tableau-lab.tbwx` from the previous lab.

1. **Choropleth Map**: Design a Choropleth map sheet to display the distribution of customers across different **States**. Utilize color density to represent the number of customers, providing an at-a-glance view of regional customer bases.

2. **Regression Plot**: Develop a regression plot sheet that examines the relationship between **Customer Lifetime Value** and **Income**. Interpret the regression line to understand how these variables correlate.

3. **Boxplot Analysis**: Create a boxplot sheet that relates **Total Claim Amount** to **Vehicle Size**. Use this visualization to assess the spread of claim amounts and identify any outliers by vehicle size category.

4. **Dashboard Creation**: Combine the above charts into a unified dashboard. Ensure that the dashboard is organized and allows for interactive exploration of the data.

5. **Story**: Synthesize your analysis into a Tableau story. Construct a narrative that guides viewers through your key findings, providing context and insights drawn from the visualizations.
